## 📝 Feature Details

### 1. Multiple Files / Zip Bundle ✅
- Client-side zip creation using JSZip
- Encrypt the bundle as single file
- Show file list on download page before commit

### 2. Password Protection (Double Encryption)
- PBKDF2/Argon2 to derive key from password
- Combine with random key for double encryption
- Password never sent to server
- Recipient needs link AND password (shared via different channel)

### 3. Custom Expiration Times ✅
- Dropdown selects for minutes/hours/days with predefined values
- Range: 5 minutes to 7 days (manages storage costs)
- Quick presets (1h, 12h, 24h) + custom option
- Real-time expiration preview in user's local timezone
- Backend validates and accepts both preset strings and numeric minutes

### 4. IP/Geo Restriction
- Use MaxMind GeoIP or CloudFront geo headers
- Allowlist/blocklist countries
- Optional IP range restriction for corporate use
- Privacy-preserving: no IP logging, just validation

### 5. Self-destructing Voice Message
- MediaRecorder API in browser
- Encrypt audio blob same as files
- Playback-only on download page (no save button)
- Auto-delete after single play

### 6. Dead Man's Switch
- User sets check-in interval (daily/weekly/monthly)
- System sends reminder to check in
- If missed → auto-share to predefined recipient
- Requires minimal identity (email) while preserving privacy
- Use case: emergency access, digital inheritance

### 7. Short URLs
- Generate 6-8 character unique codes instead of full UUIDs
- Add `short_code` field to DynamoDB record
- Reduces URL length by ~30 characters
- Benefits: easier verbal sharing, cleaner look, better QR codes
