> Zero-knowledge file and text sharing service with end-to-end encryption and one-time access

## Features

- **Client-side encryption** - Files and text are encrypted in your browser before upload (AES-256-GCM)
- **Text secrets** - Share encrypted text snippets (up to 1000 characters) without files
- **File sharing** - Upload files up to 500MB with secure encryption
- **One-time access** - Each file/text can only be viewed once, then it's automatically deleted
- **Zero-knowledge** - The server never sees your encryption keys or unencrypted content
- **No registration** - No accounts, no email, no tracking
- **Self-destructing** - Content expires after 1, 12, or 24 hours
- **Privacy-first** - Built with privacy as the core principle

## How It Works

### Uploading Files

1. Select a file and choose expiration time (1h, 12h, or 24h)
2. Your browser generates a random encryption key
3. File is encrypted locally using AES-256-GCM
4. Encrypted file is uploaded to secure storage (no filename sent to server)
5. You receive a shareable link with the decryption key and filename in the URL fragment (`#key#filename`)
6. The key and filename never leave your browser or reach the server

### Sharing Text Secrets

1. Type or paste your secret text (max 1000 characters)
2. Choose expiration time (1h, 12h, or 24h)
3. Your browser generates a random encryption key
4. Text is encrypted locally using AES-256-GCM
5. Encrypted text is sent directly to the database (no files created)
6. You receive a shareable link with the decryption key in the URL fragment
7. The key never leaves your browser or reaches the server

### Downloading/Viewing

1. Open the shared link
2. Your browser extracts the decryption key from the URL fragment
3. Click to view/download (warning: this works only once!)
4. Content is decrypted in your browser:
   - **Files**: Downloaded and saved with original filename
   - **Text**: Displayed in a copyable text area
5. Content is automatically deleted from the server
6. The link becomes invalid forever

## Security

- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM with 256-bit keys
- **Zero-knowledge**: Decryption keys and filenames stay in URL fragments, never sent to server
- **Bot protection**: Google reCAPTCHA v3 with invisible verification (deployed)
- **Origin verification**: CloudFront custom header blocks direct API access (deployed)
- **Atomic operations**: Race condition prevention using conditional database updates
- **HTTPS only**: All communication encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- **No tracking**: No user accounts, no IP logging, no analytics

### Security Layers

**Layer 1 - CloudFront Origin Verification** ✅ Deployed
- Custom secret header blocks direct API calls
- Only requests through CloudFront are accepted
- Prevents automated script abuse
- Zero cost protection

**Layer 2 - reCAPTCHA v3** ✅ Deployed
- Bot detection and prevention on all POST endpoints
- Invisible to legitimate users (score-based verification)
- Protects upload, download, and abuse report endpoints
- Minimum score threshold: 0.5 (adjustable)
- Lambda Layer for efficient dependency management

See [SECURITY_PLAN.md](./SECURITY_PLAN.md) for complete security implementation details.

## Limitations

- Maximum file size: 100 MB
- Files expire after max 24 hours
- Each file can only be downloaded once
- Desktop browsers recommended (mobile support coming soon)

## Technology

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, Web Crypto API
- **Backend**: AWS Lambda (Python 3.12), API Gateway
- **Storage**: S3 (encrypted files), DynamoDB (metadata)
- **CDN**: CloudFront
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform

## Development

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for development progress and plans.
See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- Terraform >= 1.5
- Python 3.12
- AWS CLI configured (`aws configure`)

### Quick Start - Deploy to AWS

```bash
# 1. Bootstrap Terraform backend (once per AWS account)
./scripts/bootstrap-terraform-backend.sh

# 2. Deploy infrastructure
make init-dev
make deploy-dev

# 3. Update API URLs in frontend/js/upload.js and frontend/js/download.js
# Get your API endpoint: cd terraform/environments/dev && terraform output api_endpoint

# 4. Deploy frontend
make deploy-frontend-dev

# 5. Get your CloudFront URL
cd terraform/environments/dev && terraform output cloudfront_domain
```

### Local Frontend Development

```bash
# Serve frontend locally
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8000
# Visit http://localhost:8000

# Note: You'll need to update API URLs to point to your deployed backend
```

### Deployment Status

- ✅ Development environment deployed and operational
- ✅ Production environment deployed and operational
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (159+ tests, zero mocks)

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for troubleshooting and detailed instructions.

## Testing

sdbx has a comprehensive test suite with **159+ tests** and **ZERO mocks**:

```bash
# Run all tests (backend + frontend)
make test

# Run backend tests only (Python)
make test-backend

# Run frontend tests only (JavaScript)
make test-frontend

# Run backend tests with coverage report
make test-backend-cov
```

**Test Coverage:**
- **Backend**: 135+ tests covering validation, response formatting, JSON encoding, security
- **Frontend**: 24 tests covering AES-256-GCM encryption, key management, URL encoding
- **Coverage**: ~80% of shared modules
- **Philosophy**: No mocks - testing real logic and real crypto

See [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) for detailed testing guide.
