            <h2>What is sdbx?</h2>
            <p>
                sdbx is a <strong>zero-knowledge file sharing service</strong> designed with privacy as the core principle.
                Share files securely with end-to-end encryption, one-time downloads, and no user tracking.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike traditional file sharing services, sdbx ensures that your files are encrypted <em>before</em> they
                leave your device, and the encryption key never reaches our servers. This means we literally cannot
                access your files, even if we wanted to.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                In an age where privacy is constantly under threat, we believe that sharing files shouldn't require
                sacrificing your data or trusting a third party with your sensitive information.
            </p>
            <p>
                sdbx was built to provide a simple, secure way to share files without:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating accounts or providing personal information</li>
                <li>Trusting us with your encryption keys</li>
                <li>Worrying about files being stored indefinitely</li>
                <li>Being tracked or profiled</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

                    <h4>🔐 Client-side Encryption</h4>
                    <p>
                        Your files are encrypted in your browser using AES-256-GCM before upload.
                        We never see the unencrypted content.
                    </p>

                    <h4>🔑 Zero-Knowledge Architecture</h4>
                    <p>
                        The encryption key and original filename are stored in the URL fragment (#),
                        which is never sent to our servers. Only you and the recipient have access.
                    </p>

                <div class="feature">
                    <h4>🚫 No Tracking</h4>
                    <p>
                        No user accounts, no cookies, no analytics, no IP logging.
                        We collect zero personal information.

                    <p>
                        Each file can only be downloaded once, then it's automatically and
                        permanently deleted from our servers.

            <p>To ensure optimal performance and security, sdbx has the following limitations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maximum file size: 500 MB (0.5 GB)</li>
                <li>Files expire after 1, 12, or 24 hours (your choice)</li>
                <li>Each file can only be downloaded once</li>
                <li>Desktop browsers recommended for best experience</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="card">
            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p><strong>Simple version: We collect nothing.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>We don't store unencrypted files</li>
                <li>We don't store or have access to filenames</li>
                <li>We don't have access to your encryption keys</li>
                <li>We don't log IP addresses for file access</li>
                <li>We don't use cookies, tracking, or analytics</li>
                <li>Files are automatically deleted after first download or expiration</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The only data we store is: encrypted file blobs (which we cannot decrypt),
                file size, upload timestamp, and expiration time. That's it.

                This service is provided as-is. While we implement strong encryption and security practices,

            </p>
            <p>
                For sensitive files, we recommend additional security measures like password-protecting
