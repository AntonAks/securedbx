    "general": {
      "heading": "General Questions",
      "q1": "What is sdbx?",
      "a1": "sdbx is a zero-knowledge file and text sharing service. It lets you securely share files (up to 500MB) and text secrets with end-to-end encryption. By default, content is accessed once and then permanently deleted. Vault and PIN modes also support multi-access sharing \u2014 content is automatically deleted when the expiration time (TTL) is reached.",
      "q2": "Do I need to create an account?",
      "a2": "No! sdbx requires no registration, no email, and no personal information. Simply upload your file or text, get a secure link, and share it. That's it.",
      "q3": "Is sdbx really free?",
      "a3": "Yes, sdbx is completely free to use. There are no premium tiers, no ads, and no hidden costs.",
      "q4": "What can I share with sdbx?",
      "a4html": "Two types of content: <strong class=\"text-gray-900 dark:text-slate-100\">Files</strong> (any file type up to 500MB) and <strong class=\"text-gray-900 dark:text-slate-100\">Text secrets</strong> (up to 1000 characters for passwords, API keys, notes, etc.)."
    },
    "security": {
      "heading": "Security & Privacy",
      "q1": "What does \"zero-knowledge\" mean?",
      "a1": "Zero-knowledge means we cannot access your content, even if we wanted to. Your files are encrypted in your browser before upload, and the encryption key is stored only in the URL fragment (#), which is never sent to our servers.",
      "q2": "What encryption does sdbx use?",
      "a2": "AES-256-GCM with 256-bit keys generated randomly in your browser. Each encryption uses a fresh initialization vector. All communications use TLS 1.2+.",
      "q3": "Can you see what I upload?",
      "a3": "No. We cannot see your file contents or text secrets. Everything is encrypted before it leaves your browser. We only see encrypted data, file size, and expiration time. In PIN mode, we also store the filename to deliver it to the recipient, but only temporarily \u2014 for a maximum of TTL time (24 hours). All stored data is automatically deleted after the first download or when the expiration time (TTL) is reached.",
      "q4": "Do you log IP addresses or track users?",
      "a4": "No tracking whatsoever. We store only a SHA-256 hash of your IP address for abuse prevention \u2014 the original IP cannot be recovered from the hash. We don't use cookies, don't run analytics, and don't track users in any way.",
      "q5": "Is sdbx open source?",
      "a5html": "Yes! Fully open source and available on <a href=\"https://github.com/antonaks/sdbx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-400 underline\">GitHub</a>. Security researchers are welcome to audit our code."
    },
    "howItWorks": {
      "heading": "How It Works",
      "q1": "Why can files only be downloaded once by default?",
      "a1": "One-time access is the default security model for URL link sharing. Once the recipient downloads the file, it's permanently deleted from our servers. However, Vault mode and PIN mode offer multi-access sharing \u2014 content stays available and is automatically deleted when the expiration time (TTL) is reached.",
      "q2": "What happens if my download fails due to network issues?",
      "a2": "sdbx uses a two-phase download system: when you click download, the file is reserved for 10 minutes. If your connection drops, you can retry with the same link within that window. After successful download, the file is permanently deleted.",
      "q3": "How long do files stay available?",
      "a3": "You choose when you upload: 1 hour, 12 hours, or 24 hours. After this time, files are automatically deleted, even if not downloaded.",
      "q4": "What's the difference between file sharing and text secrets?",
      "a4": "Both are encrypted the same way. Files are for documents/images up to 500MB (downloaded as a file). Text secrets are for passwords/keys up to 1000 characters (displayed directly in browser with copy button).",
      "q5": "Where is the encryption key stored?",
      "a5": "In the URL fragment (the part after #). URL fragments are never sent to servers by browsers. The key exists only in the shareable link."
    },
    "limitations": {
      "heading": "Limitations & Troubleshooting",
      "q1": "What's the maximum file size?",
      "a1": "500 MB. For larger files, consider compressing or splitting them.",
      "q2": "What browsers are supported?",
      "a2": "All modern browsers: Chrome 37+, Firefox 34+, Safari 11+, Edge 79+. Desktop browsers recommended for large files.",
      "q3": "I lost my link. Can you recover it?",
      "a3": "Unfortunately, no. Since we never see your encryption key, there's no way to recover your link. Always save links before closing the page.",
      "q4": "The link says \"already downloaded\" but I didn't download anything!",
      "a4": "Possible reasons: someone else with the link downloaded it first, the file expired, or link preview features in messaging apps triggered the download.",
      "q5": "Can I cancel or delete a shared file before it's downloaded?",
      "a5": "Currently no manual deletion. Files are automatically deleted after your chosen expiration time."
